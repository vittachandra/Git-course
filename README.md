# Credit Card Default Capstone Project

#### This repository contains the code and documentation for my capstone project on the Credit Card Default dataset. In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to gain insights into credit card default patterns.

## Dataset

#### The Credit Card Default dataset is a collection of data related to credit card clients. It includes various features such as demographic information, credit card usage, payment history, and whether the client defaulted on their credit card payment. The dataset is available in the file credit_card_default.csv.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

#### In the EDA phase of this project, I aimed to understand the characteristics of the dataset and uncover relationships between variables. The main steps I performed during the analysis are as follows:

#### Data Loading and Initial Exploration: I loaded the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook and examined its structure, dimensions, and basic statistics using descriptive functions.

#### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: I assessed the quality of the data, handled missing values, and checked for duplicates. Additionally, I transformed and standardized variables as necessary.

#### Univariate Analysis: I explored each variable individually to understand its distribution, range, and outliers. This involved generating summary statistics, histograms, and box plots.

#### Bivariate Analysis: I analyzed the relationships between pairs of variables to identify potential correlations or dependencies. I used techniques such as scatter plots, correlation matrices, and grouped analysis to uncover insights.

#### Multivariate Analysis: Building upon the bivariate analysis, I investigated relationships among multiple variables simultaneously. This allowed me to uncover more complex patterns and interactions within the dataset.

#### Visualization: Throughout the EDA process, I utilized various data visualization techniques, including bar charts, ox plots, heatmaps, and stacked area plots. These visualizations enhanced the understanding of the dataset and made it easier to communicate findings.
